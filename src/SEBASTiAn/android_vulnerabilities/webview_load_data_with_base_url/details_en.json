  "description": "An application can load a saved HTML web page as a string using loadDataWithBaseUrl() with file scheme baseURL. Since WebView has permission to access all of the appâ€™s resources, JavaScript code executing in the context of WebView will also have the same permissions. If the saved web page sources JavaScript code from a malicious server, these permissions can be abused.",
