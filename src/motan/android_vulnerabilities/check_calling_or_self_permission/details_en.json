  "name": "CheckCallingOrSelfPermission call with custom permissions",
  "description": "A component that uses run-time permission checking via checkCallingOrSelfPermission for access control grants permission to all components if it grants permission even once to a component that is in the same app as that itself. Suppose checkCallingOrSelfPermission is used to protect a component that performs a sensitive operation. In that case, a component in a malicious app can escalate its privilege and access the component.",
