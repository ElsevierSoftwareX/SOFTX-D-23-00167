  "description": "A component that uses run-time permission checking via enforceCallingOrSelfPermission for access control grants permission to all components if it grants permission even once to a component that is in the same app as that itself. If enforceCallingOrSelfPermission is used to protect a component that performs a sensitive operation, then a component in a malicious app can escalate its privilege and access the component.",
